![Long_Lat_AWS](https://github.com/takakokz/endtoend_appaws/assets/13964231/3cead01c-d37b-46d9-9fcd-b9284a7302f7)


In order to achieve it, I have created...
1. AWS Amplify to host a webpage  
2. AWS Lambda to calculate distance between 2 points
3. API to invoke Lambda function created  
4. AWS Dynamo DB then grant permission to Lambda to store/return math result into it   
5. Add API URL to code on Amplify, so Website can send Post API to calculate a value
